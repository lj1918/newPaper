The  model  takes  the  whole  Raman  spectrum  and  selects  discernable  features  from the  spectrum.  Later  on  the  model  uses  those  features  for  predicting  unknown  samples.  The developed model has been evaluated by using 10-fold cross validation approach. It basically divided  the  whole  data  set  into10-subsets.  Each  time  the  model  is  trained  on  9  subsets  and tested  on  the  remaining  one.  The  overall  process  is  repeated  10-times,  to  predict  all  the samples stepwise. The beauty of this method is that it does not care about how the data set are divided, because each data must come k-1 times in the training set and once in test set.


The overall results for the model with different kernel functions are given in Table 1. The best  performance  has  been  obtained  with  the  polynomial  kernel  function  of  order  1.  The performance  of  a  model  is  usually  evaluated  in  terms  of  accuracy,  precision,  sensitivity  and specificity.  Sensitivity  correctly  sorts  out  all  patients  with  the  disease,  whereas  specificity correctly identifies all patients who don’t have that disease [29]. A laboratory test with high specificity and sensitivity is usually desired, but rarely both of these conditions are met at the same time. The aforementioned four parameters for the current SVM model with polynomial kernel function of order 1 have been found 85%, 90%, 73% and 93%, respectively.

This  study  demonstrates  the  use  of  Raman  spectroscopy  combined  with Convex-Hull SVM  technique  for the  classification  of  the  spectral  data  acquired  from  Apple essense. Raman  spectroscopy  coupled  with  statistical  tools  has  great  potential  to  contribute significantly in the On-line inspection and research of product quality in an effective way.There is also a great  likelihood  to  use  Raman  spectroscopy  combined  with  one  of  the  existing  methods  for initial screening in order to increase the inspection efficiency. The results obtained are quite promising and interesting. The research work in our laboratory is still in progress striving for increasing sensitivity as well as specificity.

Min-max normalization was employed to normalize the sample matrix Snew. The values for ymin and ymax were set to zero and one.

The  SVM  algorithm  was  used  to  classify  the  ten  brands  of  Chinese  liquor  samples.  We selected  the  RBF  kernel  function  in  the  SVM  algorithm,  and  the  kernel  parameter  was  optimized using the PSO method. To assess the performance of the established classifier, leave-one-out cross-validatio


Basically, SVM classiﬁcation can be grouped into twotypes: linearly separable and linearly inseparable cases.The nonlinear separation can be transformed into linearcase via a suitable kernel. In linear separable case


All experiments are run on a computer with the fol-lowing features: Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz processor, 2.5 GBRAM, Linux Fedora 15 operating system. The algorithmswere implemented in the Java language. The maximum amount of random access memory given to the Java virtualmachine is set to 1.9 GB. In all cases the correspondingtraining times and achieved accuracy are measured andcompared.

The training and testing sets used in experiments werecreated by randomly splitting 70 and 30 % of data sets,respectively. The kernel used in all experiments is a radialbasis function. The RBF kernel is chosen as



Compared with the original set of support vector set instead of the original sample set, and then combined with the new sample to calculate the method compared to the calculation time is not much difference, but to improve the classification accuracy.

the algorithm that combined the original support vector set with the new sample set rather than an initial sample set,which greatly saves the computation time and accelerates the simulation speed, and the classification accuracy is basically the same.


 extends the traditional SVM method with Principal Component Analysis method and Genetic Algorithm method to construct the PCA-GA-SVM model.
 
 The traditional and most commonly used method for the classification of essence is sensory evaluation, but accuracy and objectivity cannot always be ensured because sensory evaluation staff’s judgement can affected by their health condition, emotions, and the environment.Other methods for the analysis and classification of essence are chemistry-based methods such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [5–8].These methods are highly reliable because they use a complete component-by-component approach.However, their shortcomings include high cost, being time-consuming, and low capability for insitu and online measurements [9]. Overall, developinga novel, rapid and reliable method to identify multiple essence is of positive significance.
 
 ===============================================
 Essence is widely used as a food additive in food industry.The detection of essence is is carried out by physical-chemical indexes and sensory evaluation.The former can only reflect some characteristics of essences, and it has many disadvantages, such as excessive test items, complicated operation, long detection time, low efficiency and so on.The latter's accuracy and objectivity cannot always be ensured because sensory evaluation staff’s judgement can affected by their health condition, emotions, and the environment.

So whether to provide a more reliable and stable detection of new methods, has attracted the attention of researchers.
So developing a novel, rapid and reliable method to identify multiple essences is of positive significance.

At present, the quality evaluation of essence focused on  the major aroma components, commonly used detection methods are electronic nose method, gas chromatography, gas chromatography - mass spectrometry and so on.

These methods are highly reliable because they use a complete component-by-component approach,and play an important role in the quality control of essence.However, their shortcomings include high cost, being time-consuming, and low capability for rapid essence analysis and process control$^{\cite{Jing, Y}}$.
